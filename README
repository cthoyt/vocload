How to Use This Product
-----------------------

Product:  vocload

Current Vocabularies Being Loaded by this Product:

	Structured (DAGs):

	GO = Gene Ontology
	MA = Mouse Adult Anatomy
	MP = Mammalian Phenotype

	Simple (No DAGs):

	IP = InterPro Domains (TR 3702)
	OMIM = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (TR 3853)

All Vocabulary loads require:

1.  An uppercase label for the Vocabulary

2.  A Config file (name = ${label}.config (GO.config, MA.config, etc.)).  
    Use an existing config file as a template.  Not all variables
    will be used by all loads.

3.  All Vocabs use the global Configuration file.

In addition, the 2 types of Vocabularies are implemented slightly differently:

Structured (DAGs)

	Example:  GO

	1.  XX.rcd file
	
    	This file contains the DAG definitions.  See GO.rcd.

	2.  A DAG vocabulary which uses the GO format (MA and MP both do),
	    can use GOload.py.

Simple
	Cannot perform an incremental load (at this time)

	Example:  IP (InterPro Domains)

	1.  Use simple.rcd
	
	2.  Use simpleLoad.py
