How to Use This Product
-----------------------

Product:  vocload

Vocabularies:

	Structured (DAGs):

	GO = Gene Ontology
	MA = Mouse Adult Anatomy
	MP = Mammalian Phenotype

	Simple (No DAGs):

	IP = InterPro Domains
	OMIM = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Main

All Vocabulary loads require:

1.  An uppercase label for the Vocabulary

2.  A Config file (name = ${label}.config).  Use an
    existing config file as a template.

3.  All Vocabs use the global Configuration file.

In addition, each specific type of Vocabulary is implemented
slightly differently:

	1.  XX.rcd file
	
    	This file contains the DAG definitions.  See GO.rcd.

Simple

	Example:  IP (InterPro Domains)

	1.  Use simple.rcd
	
	2.  Use simpleLoad.py
