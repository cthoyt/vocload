Current Vocabularies Being Loaded by this Product:

	Structured (DAGs):

	GO = Gene Ontology
	MA = Mouse Adult Anatomy
	MP = Mammalian Phenotype

	Simple (No DAGs):

	IP = InterPro Domains (TR 3702)
	OMIM = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (TR 3853)

Global Configs:

1. Configuration.default
   . contains environment variable definitions common to all loads
   . during installation, copy Configuration.default to Configuration 
   . edit Configuration for a specific installation

2. VOClib.config
   . contains shell functions used by all loads

Global Run Scripts:

1.  runSimpleFullLoad.sh [config file]
    . processes a simple (non-DAG) vocabulary using "full" mode
    . uses RCD_FILE = simple.rcd
    . uses LOAD_PROGRAM = simpleLoad.py

2.  runDAGIncLoad.sh [config file]
    . processes a DAG vocabulary using "incremental" mode
    . uses LOAD_PROGRAM = GOload.py
    . config file must set RCD_FILE

3.  runDAGFullLoad.sh [config file]
    . processes a DAG vocabulary using "full" mode
    . uses LOAD_PROGRAM = GOload.py
    . config file must set RCD_FILE

Note:  Simple Vocabularies cannot currently be processed in incremental
       mode.  This may have to change (maybe with OMIM?).
 
Other Globals:

1.  simple.rcd
    . a placeholder rcd file that simple vocabulary loads use
      to satisfy the input parameter requirements of the python
      load program.

2.  GOload.py
    . a python LOAD_PROGRAM which can be used by any vocabulary
      whose files use GO-DAG format (GO, MA, MP).

3.  simpleLoad.py
    . a python LOAD_PROGRAM which can be used by any simple
      vocabulary which can be loaded using "full" mode.

4.  GOverify.py
    . a python program which uses an rcd file to verify that the
      DAG files are in the correct format (no parsing errors).

All Vocabulary loads require:

1.  An uppercase label for the Vocabulary (XX)

2.  A Config file (name = ${label}.config (GO.config, MA.config, etc.)).  

    . Use GO.config as a template for a new DAG vocabulary that
      uses GO format.

    . Use an existing config file as a template.  Not all variables
      will be used by all loads.

    Note that if the load needs to execute more than one program,
    the config file can append the extra programs to the LOAD_PROGRAM
    env variable. For example, the GO.config file defines LOAD_PROGRAM
    as:
	LOAD_PROGRAM="GOverify.py ${LOAD_PROGRAM}"

3.  All Vocabs use the global Configuration file.

4.  Structured Vocabs require rcd file to define their DAGs.
